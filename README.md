# Steganosaurus
Created a system that uses a combination of image steganography and cryptography to encrypt text messages (using a pre-shared key) and conceal them in an image file for discreet movement of Information and/or to prevent and track forgery/leaking of intellectual property.

This project elaborates on the details of our product that uses a combination of image steganography and  cryptography to encrypt text messages (using a pre-shared key) and conceal them in an image file, for discreet movement of Information and/or to prevent and track forgery/leaking of intellectual property. The main aim of the product is to  introduce a unique combination of image steganography and  cryptography that complements each other and creates an extremely discreet message encoder. All the benefits of both steganography and cryptography are used to combat each other’s disadvantages and make a highly effective product. The user’s message is first in encoded using appropriate cryptographic methods by our product using the key that the user provides us, this key is then again used to encode the 
cryptographically encoded message into an image using steganography thereby providing a double protective encoding layering to the message. This image can then be transferred to the receiver, the receiver can extract the appropriate message from the image using our product provided the receiver has the appropriate decoding key. This combination of cryptography and steganography makes our product unique and extremely 
safe.
